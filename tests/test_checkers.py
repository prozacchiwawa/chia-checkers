#
# Theory of operation:
#
# This contract creates a playable game of checkers which carries some attributes
# of the game in its solution so that they can be picked out by another
# participant, including the identity of the coin that launched it, which must
# be restated to interact with it.
#
# The game is a function that accepts 4 arguments, for a normal move:
#
# ((singleton-truths...) () (move) (("launcher" . launcher-coin) ("board" board)))
#
# The game uses a board state like this:
#
# (black-to-move king-mask red-mask black-mask)
#
# And it is curried in at each stage.  The copy in the third parameter, which
# as I understand things is intended to be an alist containing data we want to
# communicate to other users should contain the identity of the original parent
# coin, "launcher", which will be verified and the board state "board", which is
# also verified before any operation.  The next move is emitted with an AGG_SIG_ME
# for the player who's turn it was, so that turn order is enforced.
#
# A move is a number as in make_move_sexp.
#
# When no moves can be taken by the next player, the winning player may win the
# game by passing () for move and the chia is given to that player.
#
# The first argument may be given as "simulate" in which case, the contract can
# be asked to give its conception of the next puzzle hash and the board state
# that goes with it, given a move.  This is used in a rudimentary way for driver
# code to be able to ask the contract what will happen when a move is requested.
